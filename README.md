# Very-accurate-Traffic-sign-detection-using-modified-YOLOv3
Traffic signs, vehicle and pedestrian detection using modified YOLOv3
In this project we aim to employ YoloV3 in traffic signs detection in addition to vehicle and pedestrian detection, we added some modifications to Yolov3 to enable it to accurately detect small traffic signs which are far away from the vehicle to early detect and recognize the traffic signs to enable the vehicle to take early action depending on this detection.
Many tests have been conducted to improve the accuracy adopting many techniques which will be published soon in a journal or conference paper since we reached very high accuracy in detection.
until now our modified network can detect 8 traffic signs classes, car and pedestrian, this project is conducted in multimedia image processing lab, department of information and communication, school of electrical engineering, Chungbuk National University.
